\title{Origins of the nectarine allele (TE insertion)}
\author{Dianne Velasco, Mallikarjuna Aradhya, Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
- recessive nectarine allele caused by TE insertion into gene
- a good estimate of the frequency of the allele is unknown
- was it likely to be from standing variation?
- what has been assessed so far
- large germplasm collection representing all/nearly all peach growing regions
- find frequency of allele
- population structure and correlate with frequency of allele
- also assess whether present in wild peach species
- suggest possible geographic origin of allele
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Peach and nectarine are the same species differing by a single recessive allele in the X gene. 
Due to a TE insertion in the coding sequence of X gene which truncates the X protein which performs X function.

% \subsection{How to add Comments}

% Comments can be added to your project by clicking on the comment icon in the toolbar above. % * <john.hammersley@gmail.com> 2016-07-03T09:54:16.211Z:

% % Here's an example comment!
% %
% To reply to a comment, simply click the reply button in the lower right corner of the comment, and you can close them when you're done.

% Comments can also be added to the margins of the compiled PDF using the todo command\todo{Here's a comment in the margin!}, as shown in the example on the right. You can also add inline comments:

% \todo[inline, color=green!40]{This is an inline comment.}

% \subsection{How to add Tables}

% Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

% \begin{table}
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{l|r}
% Item & Quantity \\\hline
% Widgets & 42 \\
% Gadgets & 13
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{How to write Mathematics}

% \LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
% \[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
%       = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
% denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


% \subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

% Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

% \subsection{How to add Lists}

% You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{enumerate}
% \dots or bullet points \dots
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

% You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

% You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.
